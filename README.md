# Aether
My attempt at creating a Horizon-esque UI library for homebrew. While there's no examples just yet I recommend looking at [NX-Activity-Log](https://github.com/tallbl0nde/NX-Activity-Log) for an example of implementation as it relies on this library for it's UI.

Documentation can be found [here](https://tallbl0nde.github.io/Aether/)!

A massive thanks to @eXhumer for preparing the documentation :)
